Timer Desktop App made with Electron, MeteorJS (based on NodeJS) to manage the time of the lawyers and let to know how much they will charge
to their clients. The app can be connected with the user of the BUNQR Law Practice Mangement App (you can see my other repository about that)
and manage the time and billing in the dashboard of the webapp.
